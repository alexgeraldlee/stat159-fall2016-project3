\section{Conclusion}

The models above tend to agree that tuition, SAT/ACT scores, total cost of attendance, the racial composition of the undergraduate classes, taking out a loan, and receiving a Pell grant. However, these variables may not be useful in the context of making changes to the campus's administration to increase competitiveness. To begin with, the fact that tuition predicts eventual earnings is clear: schools that require higher tuition levels are typically better schools academically, and thus it would be clear that attending a school with a higher tuition would lead to finding a higher-paying job in the future. It is not the case that increasing tuition at your college would necessarily lead to an increase in competitiveness. There is a similar argument for the cost of attendance, as tuition is included in that cost, and for taking out a loan, as students at universities that have higher tuition would typically have to take out loans in order to pay the amount. Of interest is the negative correlation between earnings later and receiving a Pell grant in college: the models agree that having a Pell grant predicts lower earnings later in life.
